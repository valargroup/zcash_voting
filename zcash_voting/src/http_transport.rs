///   dispatch would misreport an ambiguous POST as safe to retry.
/// - Fail closed. When the configured route is unavailable, return
///   [`RoutePhase::BeforeDispatch`]; never fall back to a direct connection.
/// - Honor `max_response_bytes`, and `timeout` where the executor can bound
///   work the SDK cannot cancel. The SDK enforces `timeout` around the whole
///   call and classifies its own deadline by whether the hook was called.
/// - `connect_timeout` is optional to honor, because only the executor can see
///   connection setup. An executor that does bound setup by it says so through
///   [`RouteHttp::enforces_connect_timeout`], and only then does the SDK read
///   a pre-dispatch failure at or after that budget as the budget expiring
///   rather than as the endpoint's answer. An executor that ignores it is
///   bounded by `timeout` alone and loses nothing else.
/// - Report `phase` truthfully. It is consulted for failures the dispatch hook
///   cannot classify, such as a body-read failure after headers arrived. A
///   `BeforeDispatch` phase reported after the hook was called is not
///   honored: the hook already said bytes may have left, and the SDK keeps
///   the more conservative answer. The one exception is an executor whose
///   HTTP client fuses connection setup with the first write and therefore
///   must call the hook before it can tell that connection setup failed; it
///   says so through [`RouteHttp::hook_precedes_connection_setup`], and
///   only then is its `BeforeDispatch` honored after the hook.
/// - Never follow redirects. Return a 3xx response as received. The SDK
