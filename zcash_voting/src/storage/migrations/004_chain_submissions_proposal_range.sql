-- v20 rebuilds `chain_submissions` so its proposal bound is the 50-proposal
-- one every current build expects.
--
-- The 15-proposal bound shipped in the hashless-submission rebuild that older
-- builds ran, and it was widened in the tree without a version bump, so a
-- sidecar migrated by one of those builds still carries the old CHECK at
-- version 19. Nothing rewrites it, and the version-19 schema fingerprint turns
-- that drift into a hard open failure for the whole sidecar. Rebuilding here
-- is a no-op for a database that already holds the widened bound.
--
-- Rows are copied verbatim: every stored proposal id satisfies the old bound
-- and therefore the wider one.
