//! Driving one round to quiescence over a [`RoundExecutor`].
//!
//! [`vote_work`](crate::vote_work) executes **one** obligation per call: it
//! resolves a step to an obligation under the right lock, runs it, and
//! returns. The step is this module's to select — it is the only caller, and
//! the epoch it dispatched under travels with the step. This module is the
//! layer above: it re-plans from durable state, chooses what to run, paces
//! re-polls, isolates failures, and stops with a reason the host can act on.
//! It owns no classification — every decision about what a step *means* stays
//! in the planner and the executor.
//!
//! Two properties are worth stating outright because they are what a host
//! loop tends to get wrong:
//!
//! - **Selection is always from a plan the driver read itself.** The plan on a
//!   [`RoundStepOutcome`] is a host-facing projection, not a control input, so
//!   the driver never selects from it.
//! - **The host context is read once per dispatch, not once per run.** A round
//!   can take minutes, and a long proof can cross the last-moment or vote-end
//!   boundary, so the step that follows must plan against the clock it
//!   actually runs under. This does not weaken "scope is captured once": each
//!   step still captures one context at entry and reads it for its whole
//!   duration.
//!
//! This file is the facade: the types a host touches, and the entry point.
//! Mechanism lives in children, one per responsibility, in the order one pass
//! uses them: `run_loop` (plan, admit, dispatch, fold, repeat), `selection`
//! (which steps a fresh plan admits, and under which lock), `signing` (whether
//! the host still owes a delegation signature), `dispatch` (running one
//! admitted obligations concurrently), `run_ledger` (what the run has accumulated and
//! whether an outcome ends it), `quiescence` (why a plan with nothing
//! dispatchable stops), `tally` (selected-vote submission progress), `policy`
//! (pacing and failure isolation) and `progress` (driver-level events).
