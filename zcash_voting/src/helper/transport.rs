//! Transport seam for helper-server HTTP requests.
//!
//! Helper share submission and status polling are the only outbound requests
//! this crate makes to vote helper servers. Like PIR and tree sync, the actual
//! socket work belongs to the host wallet: it already owns the network route
//! (a direct connection, a proxy, a pool, or Tor), and a crate-owned client
//! would silently override that choice.
//!
//! Hosts that want plain HTTPS with no extra work can use the bundled
//! [`HyperTransport`](crate::HyperTransport), which implements this trait.
//! Hosts with a custom Hyper connector can inject it through
//! [`HyperTransport::with_http_connector`](crate::HyperTransport::with_http_connector)
//! and keep the SDK's request, timeout, body-limit, and error-classification
//! behavior. Hosts using a non-Hyper HTTP stack, such as an application-owned
//! Tor client, implement [`HelperTransport`] on their own client and pass it
//! in; nothing in this module chooses a network route.
//!
//! # Why this is not [`crate::Transport`]
//!
//! The PIR transport takes no timeout and reports every failure the same way.
//! Helper retry rules depend on both: a share POST that times out **may have
//! been accepted**, so it must never be retried against the same helper, while
//! a refused connection is safe to retry. [`HelperTransportError`] preserves
//! that distinction for higher-level helper clients.
