//! Delegation as one object.
//!
//! A [`DelegationPipeline`] binds the sidecar database, a way to open the
//! wallet database, the round's lightwalletd inputs, the account, the voting
//! hotkey, and the bundle policy once. Every stage of delegation for a bundle
//! then runs from that binding, in this order:
//!
//! 1. `bundle_setup`: round row, note selection, bundle layout, eligibility.
//! 2. `proving`: bundle preparation, PCZT setup, PIR precompute with fleet
//!    failover, durable proof generation, and the final prove-and-sign.
//! 3. `signing`: resolving the SpendAuth signature from the host's
//!    [`DelegationSigner`], never from seed material inside the crate.
//! 4. `proving_thread`: the large-stack OS thread the async entry point and
//!    the process-lifetime proving-key warm-up run on.
//! 5. `executor_driver`: the object-safe [`DelegationDriver`] surface the
//!    round executor drives.
//!
//! Signing never brings seed material into the crate. A software wallet
//! implements [`SpendAuthSigner`] over its own seed and returns only the
//! SpendAuth signature; a Keystone wallet supplies the device signature.
