//! Helper-share confirmation and recovery loop.
//!
//! [`share_policy`](crate::share_policy) decides *when* a share should be
//! checked or retried, and [`share`](crate::share) stores the result. This
//! module is the part in between: it asks helpers what they know, decides what
//! their answers mean, and drives the durable state forward.
//!
//! [`track_pending_shares`] performs one pass.
//! [`share_tracking_drive`](crate::share_tracking_drive) repeats it on the
//! cadence each pass computes, so a wallet keeps only what it alone can
//! observe — app lock and account or round identity — surfaced through the
//! `cancel` callback. Calling this directly is still supported for a single
//! pass, and makes the caller responsible for the cadence again.
//!
//! # Trust model
//!
//! Helper responses are authenticated only by the host transport's connection
//! to configured endpoints. They are not chain proofs. This module requires
//! matching `confirmed` replies from two distinct currently configured helpers
//! before persisting confirmation when the fleet has at least two members. A
//! one-helper fleet necessarily uses its only configured helper. The configured
//! fleet is therefore the trusted quorum for the share nullifier's global
//! on-chain state.
