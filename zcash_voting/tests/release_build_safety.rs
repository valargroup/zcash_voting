//! Behaviour that must not be compiled out of a release build.
//!
//! Ordinary tests cannot cover this: they run with debug assertions enabled, so
//! anything hidden inside a `debug_assert!` looks like it works. The bug this
//! guards against did exactly that — a helper-attempt reservation performed its
//! only state mutation inside `debug_assert!(state.begin(&url)?)`, so release
//! builds recorded an empty `attempting_urls`, reported success, and left a
//! crash mid-POST with no evidence the helper had been contacted. Every test
//! passed.

/// escapes it; it is a guard against the obvious form, not a proof.
