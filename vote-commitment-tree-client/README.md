# vote-commitment-tree-client

HTTP client and CLI for syncing and verifying the [vote commitment tree](../vote-commitment-tree) against a running Zcash shielded-voting chain node.

Provides the library functions `zcash_voting` uses to incrementally pull new leaves from the chain after each delegation or cast-vote, and a `vote-tree-cli` binary for operator-level inspection.

## Binary

```bash
vote-tree-cli --endpoint https://vote1.example.com \
              --round-id <64-hex-chars> \
              sync
```

## Library

```rust
use vote_commitment_tree_client::Client;

let client = Client::new("https://vote1.example.com")?;
let leaves = client.leaves(round_id, from_height, to_height).await?;
```
