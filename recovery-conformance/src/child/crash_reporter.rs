//! The driver observer that dies at a named point in a round.
//!
//! Every crash point that is not the broadcast boundary is already announced
//! by the driver, and each announcement names the step it belongs to. That
//! matters here more than it does for a host UI: the driver interleaves
//! bundles, so a reporter that matched on a bare `ChainOutcome` or `TreeSynced`
//! would kill the process on whichever bundle happened to reach it first, and
//! the stage would land on a different bundle every run.
//!
//! The broadcast and share-POST stages are not here. Each sits inside one
//! transport call, which no event separates; they belong to
//! [`CrashTransport`](super::crash_transport::CrashTransport) and
//! [`CrashHelperTransport`](super::crash_helper_transport::CrashHelperTransport).
