//! The helper transport that dies mid-share-POST.
//!
//! The two share crash points sit either side of one helper POST, and neither
//! is announced by the driver: `share_tracking` journals the helper, sends, and
//! resolves the outcome inside a single step. Only the transport sees the gap.
//!
//! That gap is the whole reason `attempting_urls` exists. A helper is written
//! there before any byte is sent, so a process killed in between leaves durable
//! evidence that this helper was tried and its answer is unknown — which is
//! what stops recovery from either re-sending blindly or writing the attempt
//! off as never made.
