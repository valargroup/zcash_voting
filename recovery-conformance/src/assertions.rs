//! What a reopened sidecar must show, per stage.
//!
//! Every assertion here reads durable state through a freshly opened database,
//! because that is the only thing a crash leaves behind. Two rules shape them:
//!
//! - **The plan is the oracle.** `resume_plan` is a pure function of the
//!   sidecar, so what a round still owes is exactly what it returns. Raw rows
//!   are asserted only where the row *is* the invariant.
//! - **Normalization is lazy.** An abandoned `Submitting` row becomes
//!   `Recovering` inside the lifecycle's next admission, not when the database
//!   is opened. Asserting the raw state immediately after reopen therefore
//!   tests nothing about recovery, and an earlier version of this suite nearly
//!   reported that as a violation.
