//! Where a run is killed, and what durable commit that lands next to.

//! Each stage names one point in a round's life. The taxonomy is not a list of
//! convenient places to stop: every stage sits immediately after, or
//! immediately before, a durable commit named in `docs/chain_submission_invariants.md`
//! and `docs/round_orchestration_invariants.md`, because the whole suite asks
//! one question — given exactly this much durable state, does the round still
//! know what it owes?
