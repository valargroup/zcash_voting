# Delegation signing transaction (TX1)

## Status and scope

This document specifies the Zcash transaction that a wallet constructs for
delegation signing. In this document it is called the **delegation signing
transaction**, or **TX1**.

TX1 has the structure and signature digest of a normal Zcash transaction. It
is represented as a PCZT so that either wallet software or a hardware wallet
can produce an Ironwood SpendAuth signature using the normal Zcash signing
path.

TX1 is not the vote-chain delegation submission. The two artifacts have
different lifecycles:

```text
Zcash transaction domain                     Vote-chain domain

build TX1 PCZT
    |
    +-- ZIP-244 shielded sighash
    |       |
    |       +-- SpendAuth signature
    |                  |
    +------------------+--------------------> delegation submission
                                               + ZKP #1
                                               + rk
                                               + TX1 effecting data
                                               + SpendAuth signature
```

TX1 never becomes a Zcash transaction. It remains a PCZT signing artifact
whose input is the signed synthetic note with a synthetic authentication path.
It is not completed with an Ironwood proof or binding signature, and
transaction extraction never occurs. "Normal Zcash transaction" means only
that TX1 uses the normal transaction structure and ZIP-244 signing algorithm.
There are no Zcash transaction bytes to submit.

## Goals

TX1 provides:

- a standard PCZT input for existing Zcash signers;
- proof that the holder authorized the delegation with the Orchard/Ironwood
  account SpendAuth key;
- binding to one voting round, one delegated note bundle, and one voting
  hotkey; and
- separation between the wallet spending key and the software-managed voting
  hotkey used after delegation.

TX1 does not transfer the holder's real ZEC and does not consume the real
notes whose voting weight is delegated.

## What TX1 authorizes

TX1 is logically a delegation of voting rights from the Zcash account to one
new voting hotkey. The wallet generates that hotkey separately from the
account spending key, then uses the hotkey's one external Orchard address in
both the VAN and TX1.

For one voting identity and round, the wallet SHOULD generate one fresh
hotkey before preparing delegation bundles. If the eligible notes require
more than one bundle, every TX1 for that identity and round SHOULD delegate to
the same hotkey.

No single field carries the full meaning of the delegation. The authorization
comes from the following bindings taken together:

1. ZKP #1 proves that the real eligible notes belong to the same account that
   owns the synthetic note spent by TX1.
2. `rho_signed` binds that synthetic note to the eligible-note commitments,
   the VAN, and the voting round.
3. The VAN commits to one hotkey address, the delegated weight, and the round.
4. TX1 creates its zero-value output at that same hotkey address, and ZKP #1
   reconstructs the output commitment as `cmx_new`.
5. The account's SpendAuth signature authorizes the resulting TX1 sighash.

Consequently, a valid delegation signature and ZKP #1 statement mean:

> The account that owns these eligible notes delegates their voting weight
> for this round to this one new hotkey.

The hotkey can authorize later vote-chain actions. It cannot spend the
account's Zcash funds.

### Public-target delegation mode

The voting hotkey address may come from the same wallet that owns the funds, or
from a voter who retains the hotkey while another party controls and signs for
the funds. A custody provider is one example of that funds controller role. In
public-target mode, the voter sends only canonical `VotingHotkeyTargetV1` JSON.
The funds controller independently validates those bytes into its own local
`RoundBoundVotingHotkeyTarget`; no hotkey secret or account viewing material is
shared. TX1 construction, the account SpendAuth signature, and ZKP1 are
otherwise unchanged.

The funds controller MUST use the same target for every bundle in its round job
and retain that target across restarts. After signing the vote-chain delegation
transactions, it exports and durably stores the canonical
`DelegationCapabilityV1` bytes together with their typed digest before
broadcast. It may deliver the package while broadcasting the exact hashed
transaction bytes; the voter's matching digest is a delivery receipt. See
[Delegation capability handoff](exporting-to-external-software.md).

## Inputs

The wallet MUST fix the following inputs before building TX1:

| Input | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Network | The network stored for the voting round. |
| Snapshot height | The height at which eligible notes and witnesses were selected. |
| Consensus branch ID | The branch active at the snapshot height. It MUST match the network and height. |
| Account FVK | The 96-byte Ironwood-capable full viewing key for the account that owns the eligible notes. |
| Seed fingerprint | The ZIP-32 fingerprint used by an external signer to select the correct seed. |
| Account index | The ZIP-32 account index for the spending key. |
| Voting hotkey address | A valid 43-byte raw Ironwood address on the same network. |
| Voting round ID | Exactly 32 bytes, represented by this crate as 64 hexadecimal characters. |
| Eligible note slots | One to five real notes, padded to `BUNDLE_NOTE_SLOTS` with the circuit's synthetic padding notes. |
| VAN commitment | The commitment to the voting hotkey, delegated weight, round, and blinding factor. |
| Round name and weight | Display-only memo data. |

The account FVK, account index, seed fingerprint, network, selected notes,
padding secrets, voting hotkey, and voting round ID MUST be taken from the same
persisted delegation-bundle context. A wallet MUST NOT allow an external
signer response to replace any of these values.

## Notes used by TX1

There are three different kinds of notes in the construction:

- **Eligible notes** are the holder's real Zcash notes at the voting snapshot.
  They are witnesses to ZKP #1 and are not spent by TX1.
- **Padding notes** fill ZKP #1's fixed five-note input. They are synthetic,
  and TX1 does not spend them.
- The **signed note** is one additional synthetic note created only as TX1's
  spend. Its constrained `rho_signed` binds the signature to the delegation.

TX1 also has a separate, zero-value output note addressed to the hotkey. That
output is not the signed note.

### Which eligible notes reach a bundle

Not every selected note is delegated. Bundle planning drops notes twice, for
different reasons, and a wallet should present the two differently:

- Bundles whose total falls below `BALLOT_DIVISOR` are dropped because they are
  worth zero ballots after quantization. Nothing is lost.
- Trailing bundles are dropped by the **privacy trim** even though they carry
  real weight. Bundle count is `ceil(note_count / BUNDLE_NOTE_SLOTS)`, so a
  holder whose value sits in a few large notes plus a long dust tail emits many
  TX1s and delegation submissions that contribute almost nothing. Planning trims
  that tail down to `BundlePolicy::max_privacy_bundles` while the discarded raw
  note value stays inside `BundlePolicy::privacy_drop_bps` of the selected note
  value and the absolute `max_privacy_drop_zatoshi` ceiling. Defaults are 1% and
  1,000 ZEC. The count is a target; both budget limits are hard ceilings.

Trimmed notes never appear in any TX1, VAN, or delegation submission, so the trim
leaves no on-chain trace. `PrivacyTrim::dropped_value_zatoshi` reports the raw
value of the excluded notes, not their bundle-quantized voting weight. Wallets
SHOULD surface that distinction rather than reducing voting power silently.

The trim composes with a per-bundle value threshold rather than replacing it. A
1% budget below 1,000 ZEC cannot pay for a bundle sitting near a 1,000 ZEC
per-bundle cap, so smaller concentrated holders only shed their dust tail. At
100,000 ZEC selected value, however, 1% reaches the default 1,000 ZEC absolute
ceiling and can remove one full 1,000 ZEC bundle. The absolute ceiling prevents
the default trim from removing more than 1,000 ZEC in total; callers can set a
tighter ceiling or explicitly remove it. Holders whose uniformly sized tail
bundle exceeds the effective budget see no reduction. The trim narrows the "this
voter emitted many submissions" inference for concentrated holders; it does not
make bundle counts uniform across voters.

### Eligible and padding note slots

ZKP #1 always has `BUNDLE_NOTE_SLOTS` note slots. The wallet places the real
eligible notes first, in persisted bundle order, then fills the remaining
slots with the exact synthetic padding notes used by the proof.

For every padding slot, the wallet samples a fresh valid `rho` and a fresh
valid `rseed`, constructs a note for the delegating account, and computes its
extracted note commitment. The wallet persists these padding secrets because
the proof must reconstruct the same notes.

Let `cmx[0]` through `cmx[4]` be the canonical 32-byte encodings of the
extracted commitments in that exact slot order. Implementations MUST NOT sort
or otherwise reorder the commitments after padding.

### How `rho_signed` is chosen

`rho_signed` is not sampled and is not copied from an eligible or padding
note. It is deterministically derived as the seven-input Pallas Poseidon hash:

```text
rho_signed =
    Poseidon(cmx[0], cmx[1], cmx[2], cmx[3], cmx[4], VAN, round_id)
```

Each input is interpreted from its canonical 32-byte encoding as a Pallas base
field element. `VAN` is the already-computed commitment containing the one
hotkey address, delegated weight, round, and VAN blinding value. `round_id` is
the same voting-round field element used in the VAN and ZKP #1.

The same seven inputs always produce the same `rho_signed`. Local voting hotkey
delegation derives its VAN blinding from the hotkey secret, network, round
parameters, bundle index, and real note identities. Restoring or reusing all of
those inputs with `recoverable_bundle_policy_v1()` reproduces the same VAN. The
policy pins the complete bundle shape, including the 25,000 ZEC addition
threshold used for canonical ZIP-318 notes. A fresh voting database may
generate different padding notes, so rebuilding the delegation can produce a
different `rho_signed` and PCZT even though it reconstructs the same VAN. That
difference does not affect an already-confirmed delegation. Once the VAN and
its on-chain leaf position have been recovered, later voting uses the VAN
blinding and a Merkle witness for that position, not `rho_signed` or the
padding-note secrets. Public target delegation has no local hotkey secret and
continues to sample a fresh VAN blinding.

### How the signed note is made

After deriving `rho_signed`, the wallet:

1. derives the recipient from the delegating account FVK at external
   diversifier index zero;
2. samples a fresh 32-byte `rseed_signed`, retrying until it is valid for
   `rho_signed`; and
3. constructs an Ironwood V3 note with:

   ```text
   recipient = account_fvk.address_at(0, External)
   value     = 1 zatoshi
   rho       = rho_signed
   rseed     = rseed_signed
   ```

The 1-zatoshi value makes the action non-zero for existing signer display
paths. It is synthetic and is not taken from the holder's balance.

The signed note is not in the Zcash note-commitment tree. Under the V6
pre-authorization flow, the PCZT therefore leaves the Ironwood anchor and the
spend's Merkle witness unset. TX1 is never proved or broadcast, so no Updater
needs to supply them later.

ZKP #1 MUST reconstruct the signed-note nullifier from the exact same note:
the delegating-account recipient, 1-zatoshi value, `rho_signed`,
`rseed_signed`, V3 note version, and account key material. TX1
places this nullifier in its spend, so it is covered by the ZIP-244 sighash.
This is what binds the signature to the eligible-note slots, VAN, hotkey, and
round.

```text
eligible notes --+
padding notes ----+--> cmx[0..4] --+
                                      |
one hotkey address --> VAN ------------+--> rho_signed
round ---------------------------------+        |
                                                v
signed note --> nf_signed --> TX1 sighash --> SpendAuth signature
     |
     +-- owned by the delegating account

one hotkey address --> zero-value output --> cmx_new
```

## Transaction construction

### Global fields

The wallet MUST construct the PCZT global fields as follows:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction version | `TxVersion::suggested_for_branch(branch_id)` |
| Consensus branch ID | Branch active at the voting snapshot height |
| Lock time | `0` |
| Expiry height | `0` |
| Transparent bundle | Absent |
| Sapling bundle | Absent |
| Orchard bundle | Absent |
| Ironwood bundle | Present, V3 |

The current library accepts only the NU6.3 branch, so the suggested
transaction version resolves to V6.

The zero expiry height is part of the PCZT signing digest only; TX1 never
becomes a transaction whose expiry could be evaluated by consensus.

### Ironwood bundle

The wallet MUST use the Ironwood builder with the V3 bundle version, default
flags, and `BundleType::UNPADDED`.

The fixed profile has one real spend and one real output. The unpadded builder
pairs them in one action, whose index is `0`. The wallet MUST persist that
action index with the signing request.

The real spend is:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Note | The signed synthetic note |
| Merkle witness | Absent under V6 pre-authorization |
| Anchor | Absent under V6 pre-authorization |
| `alpha` | Fresh scalar sampled by the Ironwood builder |
| `rk` | Randomized verification key derived from `ak` and `alpha` |
| ZIP-32 path | `m / 32' / coin_type' / account'` |

The real output is:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Recipient | Voting hotkey address |
| Value | `0` zatoshi |
| OVK | `None` (no account outgoing viewing key) |
| Memo | 512-byte delegation display memo |
| `rseed_output` | Fresh randomness sampled by the builder |

The implementation currently has a 1-zatoshi synthetic spend and a zero-value
output. This produces a nominal positive 1-zatoshi shielded value balance.
No real fee is paid because the PCZT never becomes a Zcash transaction.

The zero-value output is protocol-relevant: ZKP #1 reconstructs `cmx_new` for
that same output value. Implementations MUST NOT change it to a 1-zatoshi
output without changing and versioning the proof statement.

### Memo

The current display memo is:

```text
I am authorizing this hotkey managed by my wallet to vote on {round_name}.
Amount: {whole}.{fraction:08} ZEC.
```

The memo is informational. It is covered by the transaction sighash, but the
vote-chain verifier does not parse it. Wallets SHOULD show the same round,
weight, and hotkey address in their own confirmation UI instead of relying
only on a hardware signer's interpretation of the PCZT.

### PCZT finalization

After the bundle is built, the wallet MUST:

1. add the hardened ZIP-32 derivation path to the real spend;
2. build the PCZT with the Creator role;
3. run the IO Finalizer role;
4. serialize the full PCZT;
5. compute `Signer::shielded_sighash()` from the finalized PCZT;
6. encode the finalized Ironwood action's effecting data; and
7. persist the effecting data, sighash, `rk`, `alpha`, `nf_signed`, `cmx_new`,
   both rseeds, and proof inputs before requesting a signature, while retaining
   the action index with the active signing request.

The caller MUST retain the exact full PCZT for the active signing session.
The current voting database persists the binding fields, but not the full PCZT
bytes.

The sighash is the 32-byte ZIP-244 shielded signature digest. It is not a
custom voting hash.

### Submission effect encoding

The vote-chain submission carries the finalized action effecting data, not the
PCZT. The current encoding is exactly 821 bytes:

```text
version[1] || action[0][820]
```

The version byte is `1`. Each action is encoded in PCZT order as:

| Field | Length |
| --- | ---: |
| `cv_net` | 32 |
| `nullifier` | 32 |
| `rk` | 32 |
| `cmx` | 32 |
| `ephemeral_key` | 32 |
| `enc_ciphertext` | 580 |
| `out_ciphertext` | 80 |

The remaining TX1 effecting fields are fixed by this construction: V6 on
NU6.3, lock time and expiry height zero, no transparent, Sapling, or Orchard
bundle, and one Ironwood V3 bundle with default flags, a positive 1-zatoshi
value balance, and exactly one action. V6 shielded signatures do not commit
to the bundle anchor, so the anchor is not included.

The synthetic output is constructed without the governance account's outgoing
viewing key. Its published `out_ciphertext` therefore cannot be recovered with
that account's FVK. The PCZT retains the output metadata needed by the signer.

A verifier can reconstruct the ZIP-244 shielded sighash from this payload and
the fixed profile. It must require the action to match the submitted `rk`,
`nf_signed`, and `cmx_new`, recompute the sighash, and verify the SpendAuth
signature against that digest. The shared fixture
[`delegation_tx1_effects_v1.json`](../zcash_voting/test-vectors/delegation_tx1_effects_v1.json)
pins this boundary for implementations in other repositories.

## Signing

### Software wallet

Software signing MUST remain inside the wallet's seed boundary:

1. Verify that the selected seed's ZIP-32 fingerprint equals the persisted
   signing request fingerprint.
2. Derive the unified spending key for the request network and account index.
3. Derive the SpendAuthorizingKey `ask`.
4. Parse the persisted `alpha` as a canonical Pallas scalar.
5. Compute the randomized signing key `rsk = ask.randomize(alpha)`.
6. Produce a RedPallas SpendAuth signature over the exact persisted 32-byte
   sighash using fresh CSPRNG randomness.

Only the 64-byte signature should cross back out of the wallet signing
boundary.

### External signer

For a PCZT signer such as Keystone, the wallet MUST:

1. redact the full PCZT for the Signer role;
2. send only the redacted PCZT to the signer;
3. receive a structurally parseable signed PCZT;
4. extract the SpendAuth signature from the persisted action index; and
5. pair the signature with the original persisted sighash and `rk`.

The wallet MUST NOT accept an `rk`, sighash, action index, network, account
path, or delegation field supplied separately by the signer response.

## Verification and submission

Before assembling the vote-chain delegation submission, the wallet MUST:

1. require a 32-byte sighash and 64-byte signature;
2. require the supplied sighash to equal the write-once persisted TX1
   sighash;
3. verify the signature under the write-once persisted `rk` and sighash;
4. require the versioned TX1 effecting data to match the write-once persisted
   setup payload;
5. require ZKP #1 public values `rk`, `nf_signed`, `cmx_new`, VAN, and
   governance nullifiers to equal the values persisted during TX1 setup; and
6. verify the final delegation proof before releasing a submission whenever
   the wallet has a local verifier available.

The vote-chain submission contains the SpendAuth signature, `rk`, and the
compact effecting data from which the verifier reconstructs the sighash. It is
not TX1, does not contain a Zcash transaction, and never carries a PCZT.

A separate funds controller can instead prepare TX1 for a voter's public,
round-bound hotkey target and deliver the resulting runtime data through a
`DelegationCapabilityV1`. The voter retains the hotkey secret; the funds
controller retains its account keys. The delivery receipt and validation
contract is documented in
[delegation capability handoff](exporting-to-external-software.md).

Signing state is one-shot. After a restart, the wallet MAY resume only if it
retained the exact signing request, including the full PCZT. Otherwise it MUST
clear the unsigned setup and build a fresh one. It MUST NOT combine `alpha`,
`rk`, action fields, rseeds, a sighash, or a signature from different setup
attempts.

## Rust example

The caller first prepares a [`PreparedDelegationBundle`][prepared] using the
wallet and round state. TX1 construction itself is then:

```rust
use anyhow::{ensure, Context, Result};
use zcash_voting::prelude::{
    pczt_sighash, spend_auth_signature, NoopProgressReporter,
    PreparedDelegationBundle, PreparedSigner, VotingDb,
};

fn build_tx1(
    voting_db: &VotingDb,
    prepared: &PreparedDelegationBundle,
) -> Result<zcash_voting::delegate::KeystoneSigningRequest> {
    let progress = NoopProgressReporter;
    let request = prepared
        .keystone_request(voting_db, &progress)
        .context("build TX1 and persist its binding fields")?;

    let recomputed = pczt_sighash(&request.pczt_bytes)?;
    ensure!(
        recomputed.as_slice() == request.pczt_sighash.as_slice(),
        "TX1 sighash does not match its serialized PCZT"
    );
    ensure!(request.rk.len() == 32, "TX1 rk must be 32 bytes");

    // Display `request.display_memo`, the voting hotkey address, and bundle
    // weight in the wallet UI. Send only `redacted_pczt_bytes` to Keystone.
    Ok(request)
}

fn accept_signed_tx1(
    voting_db: &VotingDb,
    prepared: &PreparedDelegationBundle,
    request: &zcash_voting::delegate::KeystoneSigningRequest,
    signed_pczt_bytes: &[u8],
) -> Result<zcash_voting::delegate::DelegationSubmission> {
    let action_index =
        usize::try_from(request.action_index).context("invalid action index")?;
    let signature = spend_auth_signature(signed_pczt_bytes, action_index)
        .context("extract TX1 SpendAuth signature")?;
    let signer = PreparedSigner::signature_from_bytes(
        &signature,
        &request.pczt_sighash,
    )?;

    // `submission` checks the supplied sighash against persisted TX1 state
    // and verifies the signature under the persisted rk. ZKP #1 must have
    // been generated before this call.
    prepared
        .submission(voting_db, signer)
        .context("assemble vote-chain delegation submission")
}
```

The complete caller-oriented flows are implemented in
[`wallet-example/src/example_delegation.rs`][example]:

- `build_keystone_delegation_request` builds TX1 and returns the full and
  signer-redacted PCZTs;
- `prove_and_submit_keystone_delegation_bundle` extracts the returned
  SpendAuth signature and assembles the delegation submission; and
- `prove_and_submit_delegation_bundle` demonstrates the equivalent
  wallet-owned software signing path.

## Durable Keystone requests

Setup stores the exact finalized PCZT atomically with its signing fields.
Keystone request creation reloads those bytes, including after background ZKP1
or restart, and validates the selected notes, hotkey target, sighash, and unique
matching randomized key. It never substitutes newly randomized bytes for an
existing setup. Schema 21 adds this nullable field; legacy rows without the
original transaction fail with `DelegationReconciliationRequired`.

Output target validation uses the action spend nullifier as the output note's
rho, as the transaction builder does. This follows “New note commitment
integrity” in section 4.18.4 of the NU6.3 proposal snapshot
`v2026.7.0-187-ge753a6` ([pinned source](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/e753a6a301912cf77202db8f0d840f4796f5cca1/protocol/protocol.tex#L8104-L8110)).

Regression coverage lives in `delegate/tests/keystone.rs`: request reuse after
setup and restart, concurrent request creation, legacy rejection without
rebuilding, and changed-note, changed-target, and corrupt-PCZT rejection.
