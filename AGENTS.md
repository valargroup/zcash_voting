# Repository agent instructions

This file is the single source of agent instructions for this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, so Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor all read the
same text; edit `AGENTS.md` and never add a second instructions file.

Tool-specific wiring, all pointing at the same shared content:

- `.agents/skills/` holds the shared skill definitions.
- `.claude/skills/` and `.cursor/skills/` symlink into `.agents/skills/`.
- Codex has no skill loader, so anything it must follow is stated in full in
  this file, with a link to the source of truth.

## Build and test

Use the `make` targets. They are the only supported entry points:

**Default loop — use these:**

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make check` | Type-check the default Zakura stack. The fast inner loop. |
| `make test` | Run the default Zakura test suite. The default gate. |
| `make clippy` / `make fmt` | Lint and formatting checks. |

**Run only when the change calls for it, or when asked:**

| Command | When |
| --- | --- |
| `make test-lrz` | Only for changes to LRZ-gated code, backend feature wiring, or `Cargo.toml` feature definitions. |
| `make test-vct` | Only for changes under `vote-commitment-tree/` or `vote-commitment-tree-client/`. |
| `make doc-test` | Only when doc comments containing examples changed. |
| `make msrv` | Only when adding a dependency or using a newer language feature. |
| `make proofs` | Only for changes to circuit inputs or proving code. Very slow. |
| `make help` | List all targets. |

**Prefer the default Zakura path.** `make check` and then `make test` is the
normal cycle, and passing them is enough to consider a change verified unless it
touches one of the areas above. `zakura` is the default feature and the path
nearly all changes affect; the `lrz` variants build a second, entirely separate
crypto stack and roughly double the work for no added signal on Zakura-only
changes. CI runs every backend on every pull request, so skipping them locally
does not let a regression through. Do not run the LRZ or VCT suites
speculatively or "to be safe".

Each target pins its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` per feature permutation
(`target/zakura`, `target/lrz`, `target/vct`). This matters: the `zakura` and
`lrz` features are mutually exclusive and pull two separate crypto stacks, so a
bare `cargo` command that switches backends inside one target directory
recompiles the entire Halo2 dependency graph. `make check` and `make test` also
resolve to identical features, so they reuse each other's build artifacts.

Prefer `make check` over `make test` while iterating; it is much faster and
catches most errors.

Do not:

- run ad-hoc `cargo build` / `cargo test` / `cargo check` invocations — they use
  the shared default target directory and cause full-graph rebuilds;
- pass `--all-features` or a bare `--no-default-features`; CI asserts that both
  **fail**, because a wallet backend must be selected and the two backends are
  mutually exclusive;
- run the `#[ignore]` proof tests in debug. `zcash_voting/src/zkp1.rs` and
  `zcash_voting/src/delegation_capability.rs` hold three of them; they run
  Halo2 keygen plus proving, and one generates two real ZKP2 proofs. Use
  `make proofs`, which runs them in release.

`make pir-smoke` needs a sibling `../vote-nullifier-pir` checkout and is not
part of the test suite.

`make stage-bench` provisions a real round on the staging vote chain and drives
it over the network to measure where a vote's time goes; it is not part of the
test suite either. `make stage-bench-unit` runs its hermetic tests. See
[`stage-bench/README.md`](stage-bench/README.md).

## Code standards

These rules apply to all Rust in this workspace. Apply them by default when
writing or editing code; they do not need confirmation. Before a refactor that
moves or renames anything, read the full standard in
[`.agents/skills/core-rust-readability/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/core-rust-readability/SKILL.md),
which is the canonical text this section summarizes.

- **Name for the domain concept**, not the action or the underlying type. Reject
  `data`, `state`, `result`, `body`, `out`, `node`, `best` and similar
  placeholders when a specific name exists. Files and modules get discoverable
  domain names too.
- **Document public items and non-obvious methods** with purpose, validations,
  side effects, and postconditions or invariants. Explain domain terms and enum
  variants whose meaning is not self-evident.
- **Keep a thin facade with private children** rather than growing an overloaded
  multi-responsibility file. Split by responsibility or phase, not by line
  count. The facade shows entry points and phase order; children hide mechanism.
- **Keep each layer's API at its own abstraction level.** A low-level store
  should expose domain-neutral storage operations, not encode higher-level
  workflows. Prefer one cohesive typed transition API over several overlapping
  special-case methods; avoid `_inner` / `_with_conn` / `_for_<caller>` families.
- **Put tests in a `tests/` sibling directory** grouped by behavior with shared
  fixtures, not in an inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` appended to the production
  file.
- **Keep test-only fixtures and `#[cfg(test)]` branches out of production
  paths** when a black-box test or test helper can observe the same behavior.
- **Use distinct, accurate errors for distinct states**, so debugging does not
  require reading the implementation.

`zcash_voting/src/share_policy/` and `zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/` are the
in-repo examples of the target shape: a thin facade `mod.rs` holding the child
declarations, shared DTOs, and re-exports, with phase children beside it and
behavior-grouped tests in a `tests/` sibling. Read one of them before adding a
new module.

Several large files (`storage/operations.rs`, `storage/queries/mod.rs`,
`vote.rs`, `session.rs`, `config/mod.rs`, `delegate.rs`) predate this standard
and carry inline test modules and mixed responsibilities. They are legacy, not
the pattern; do not copy their layout into new code, and do not reformat them
wholesale as a side effect of an unrelated change.

## Release branches

`main` is the development line for the next release. Shipped release series are
maintained on release branches. The supported lines are currently
`release/v3.x`, `release/v4.0.x`, and `release/v5.0.x`; v3 retains its
historical branch name, while new lines use `release/vMAJOR.MINOR.x`.

Do not push a fix directly to a maintenance branch. Land it on `main` first,
then apply the matching `A:backport/*` label so Mergify opens a reviewed
backport PR. A source PR may carry more than one target label. Only
semver-compatible changes may be backported.

Read [`docs/release-branches.md`](docs/release-branches.md) before deciding
which branch a change targets, applying a backport label, or cutting a new
maintenance line. It is the source of truth for the branching and release
process; keep it updated in the same change whenever that process changes.

## Round orchestration

Before changing round planning (`zcash_voting/src/session.rs`,
`zcash_voting/src/round_planning/`) or vote-work execution
(`zcash_voting/src/vote_work/`), read and follow
[`docs/round_orchestration_invariants.md`](docs/round_orchestration_invariants.md).
It is the review specification for how durable state and the authenticated
roster become obligations, how those are executed, and which identities are
durable. Update it and its named conformance tests in the same change whenever
behavior intentionally changes, and report any conflict between a requested
change and the specification before implementing it.

## Helper-share submission

Before changing helper-share planning, submission, transport, persistence,
polling, or recovery, read and follow
[`docs/helper_submission_invariants.md`](docs/helper_submission_invariants.md).

The document is the review specification for the invariants currently enforced
by this repository. In particular:

- do not weaken or bypass an invariant silently;
- preserve durable state transitions, timeout and retry boundaries, helper
  placement rules, and ambiguous-POST safety;
- update the specification and its cited regression tests in the same change
  whenever behavior intentionally changes; and
- explicitly report any conflict between a requested change and the
  specification before implementing it.

These instructions apply to all files that can affect helper-share behavior,
including the `zcash_voting/src/share_policy/` and
`zcash_voting/src/share_tracking/` facade packages,
`zcash_voting/src/share.rs`, `zcash_voting/src/recovery.rs`,
`zcash_voting/src/helper/`, `zcash_voting/src/storage/queries/`, and
helper-share wire representations.
